# 🖼️ Frame by Frame: A Journey in Motion

## ✨ Overview

Frame by Frame: A Journey in Motion is an interactive image gallery that uses smooth transitions and dynamic panels to provide an engaging user experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the gallery allows users to click on panels, expanding them to reveal images and text while other panels gracefully contract. The responsive design ensures the layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, offering a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The project focuses on simplicity and elegance, with animated text that slides into view as panels open, adding an extra layer of interactivity. Using CSS flexbox for layout and transitions, the gallery maintains a clean structure and fluid movements. Ideal for showcasing visuals, it’s designed for photographers, artists, or anyone looking to create an engaging, interactive portfolio.
